# LoxInterpreter

This project follows the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) to implement an interpreter for [The Lox Language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html). In particular, this project reimplements

* the lox interpreter in Java and
* the clox bytecode generator in c.

## Build

I build this project with eclipse. However, the project should not have any external dependancies (apart from the Java STL). Therefore it should be possible to build it from any other development environment.
